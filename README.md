❤️ Heart Disease Prediction 

📌 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction can help in taking preventive measures and improving patient outcomes.
This project aims to predict the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) using patient health and lifestyle data with machine learning techniques.

🎯 Objective

To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a person is likely to develop heart disease within the next 10 years based on medical and behavioral features.
